    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>My Mind: A cognitive digital twin</b>
            <ul>
                <li>The problem we are attempting to solve with the help of our research project is ’Student Mental Health’.
                    Current branches of psychology have minimalist use in the advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Machine
                    Learning, and Reinforcement learning to identify mental disorders. Our main objective as part of this
                    research project is to utilize the untapped potential of AI, ML, and reinforcement learning along with the
                    psychological test batteries to improvise the process of Identification of Mental Health Disorders. We aim
                    to achieve this by trying to implement a concept called “Digital Twin” which can be defined as a virtual
                    model designed to accurately reflect a physical object. We plan to create a cognitive digital twin of the
                    brain of the patient and identify mental disorders.</li>

        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/N-Raghav/Tennis-Ball-detection-using-OpenCV-and-ROS">Tennis Ball Detection Using OpenCV and ROS</a></b>
                <ul>
                    <li>OpenCV and ROS to develop ball tracking program that read video frames from a video file and using a
                        USB camera.</li>

        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/mukesh-tp/MusicRecommendationSystem">Music Recommendation System</a></b>
                <ul>
                        <li>Using Python libraries like Spotipy, Pandas, Numpy, and SKlearn, we created a music recommendation
                            system. We utilized the principles of a Content-based recommendation system. My role in the project
                            was the vectorization of the music properties and finding similar songs using cosine similarity</li>
